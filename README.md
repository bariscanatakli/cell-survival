# Reinforcement Learning-Based Cell Survival Simulation

## Project Overview
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) simulation where virtual cells learn survival strategies in a dynamic environment. Using Deep Q-Networks (DQN), the cells evolve to find food, avoid dangers, and interact with their surroundings.

## Project Objectives
- Create an interactive simulation for AI-powered cells.
- Implement DQN for decision-making.
- Design an environment for navigation, food collection, and hazard avoidance.
- Establish reward mechanisms to promote optimal behaviors.
- Develop evolutionary strategies for long-term survival.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 1.x, OpenAI Gym, Pygame, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Environment Design
The simulation features a grid-based environment where cells can observe their surroundings, including food sources, hazards, and other entities. The cells can perform basic movements and interactions, such as consuming food and reproducing.

## Learning Algorithm
The project utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for training the cells. Key components include a neural network for approximating Q-values, experience replay for stable learning, and an epsilon-greedy strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation.

## Evolutionary Mechanisms
The simulation incorporates natural selection, where the best-performing cells survive and reproduce, along with mutation mechanisms to explore new behaviors.

## Implementation Plan
The project is structured over six weeks, focusing on environment setup, DQN implementation, agent training, evolutionary mechanisms, visualization tools, and optimization.

## Expected Outcomes
- Cells that efficiently navigate towards food while avoiding hazards.
- Demonstration of learning progress and evolutionary adaptations.
- Visual representations of cell behavior and decision-making processes.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Survival Rate
- Food Collection Efficiency
- Learning Speed
- Evolutionary Progress
